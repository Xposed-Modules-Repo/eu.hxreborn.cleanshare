# CleanShare

CleanShare is an Xposed module that removes Direct Share's suggested contact/conversation shortcuts from Android's Share Sheet.

## About

Direct Share suggests contacts you emailed once five years ago, colleagues from jobs you no longer have, and people you'd rather not be reminded of. The suggestions are [rarely useful](https://support.google.com/android/thread/153774734). I've yet to hit a case where they helped. Might as well cut the row and skip the hassle.

CleanShare tricks `IntentResolver` into thinking it's running on a low-RAM device. Android then skips the Direct Share pipeline to save resources, so the row never loads.

On devices with [Android System Intelligence](https://www.androidpolice.com/what-is-android-system-intelligence/), it also blocks backend shortcut queries to prevent share target profiling.

## Requirements

- Android 14 (API 34) or higher
- [LSPosed](https://github.com/JingMatrix/LSPosed) (JingMatrix fork recommended)
- Pixel or AOSP-based ROM (OEM skins untested)

## Installation

1. Download the latest APK from [Releases](https://github.com/hxreborn/cleanshare/releases).
2. Install and enable the module in LSPosed.
3. Configure the scope:
   - `com.android.intentresolver` – Hides the Direct Share row.
   - `com.google.android.as` – Blocks shortcut profiling.
4. Reboot your device.
